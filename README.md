### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Neki, an argentinian otaku that codes in his free time! I speak English and Spanish :)

#### What I do

I usually contribute to open-source anime-related projects (which are in an acceptabe state of mantainance). I sometimes work in my own anime-reated open-source projects when I have nothing better to do.

### Hi there üëã

I am Neki, an argentinian otaku that codes in his free time! I speak English and Spanish :)

#### What I do ‚úç

I usually contribute to open-source anime-related projects (which are in an acceptabe state of mantainance). I sometimes work in my own anime-reated open-source projects when I have nothing better to do.

#### My projects üõ†

[Shiroi Kagi](https://shiroi-kagi-rythm-of-music.rafabradley.repl.co/): An osu-like web-based videogame which won a mention in Kajam 2021.<br>
[anime-api](https://pypi.org/project/anime-api): A collection of python 3 anime API wrappers.<br>
[Nekos API](https://nekos.nekidev.com): A free and open-source anime images API

#### Fun facts üòÇ

- I like making videogames. I'm not a fan of playing them.
- Shiroi Kagi is a good game. It's code is terrible.

#### What I like üíó

There are lots of things I like. Anime, manga, Hatsune Miku, coding, python3 and sailing are some, but there are many more that I cannot put here because the list would be infinite.
